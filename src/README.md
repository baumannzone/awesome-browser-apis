## ðŸ˜± I DIDN'T KNOW I COULD DO THIS WITH THE BROWSER

Gone are those times when web browsers were used to render text and little else...  
These are modern times! Even for browsers, which are currently full of interesting _features_ for developers, many of
them unknown.

In this talk, we will explore some of the most curious functionalities (_APIs_) of the browser. We will see some APIs (
voice, multimedia recording, bluetooth, vibration, etc.) and we will explain what they do, how we can use them and why
they are so fun.

Surely you don't know them all!
