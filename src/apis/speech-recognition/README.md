# Speech Recognition
> aka Voice to Text API

::: tip
Speech recognition is the ability of a machine or program to identify words and phrases in spoken language and convert them to a machine-readable format. Introduced in 2012 by W3C.  
The HTML5 Speech Recognition API allows JavaScript to have access to a browserâ€™s audio stream and to convert it to text.
